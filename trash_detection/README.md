# Trash Detection AI

Welcome to Trash Detection, a simple project aimed at detecting and classifying different types of trash in images using artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. This project utilizes machine learning models to automatically identify and categorize various types of waste commonly found in images.

## Project Overview:

This project focuses on the following key components:

## 1. Dataset:
A TACO dataset containing annotations of different types of trash such as plastic bottles, cans, paper, etc., along with their corresponding labels.

## 2. Model Development:
Training a YOLO v8 model on custom data.

## 3. Inference:
Implementing the trained model to perform inference on new images, identifying and labeling the presence of trash items.
