# Tweets Sentiment Analysis Algorithm

## Description
This sentiment analysis model utilizes logistic regression to determine the sentiment conveyed in a given tweet or text. It's trained to classify the sentiment as positive or negative based on the content of the statement.

## How it works
The algorithm employs logistic regression, a machine learning technique, to analyze the sentiment of text data. It processes the input text and assigns a probability score indicating the likelihood of the sentiment being positive or negative. The sentiment with the higher probability is then classified as the predicted sentiment of the text.

## Usage
To use this sentiment analysis algorithm, simply input the tweet or text you want to analyze. The algorithm will return the predicted sentiment (positive or negative) based on the content of the input text.

## Training
The algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset containing examples of tweets or text along with their corresponding sentiment labels (positive or negative). The logistic regression model learns from this data to accurately classify the sentiment of new text inputs.
