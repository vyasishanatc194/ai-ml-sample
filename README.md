# AI-ML Sample Projects

This repository contains four different AI projects aimed at solving various tasks using machine learning and computer vision techniques. Each project addresses a specific problem and utilizes different algorithms and models for its solution.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Tweets Sentiment Analysis Algorithm

**Description:**  
This sentiment analysis model utilizes logistic regression to determine the sentiment conveyed in a given tweet or text. It's trained to classify the sentiment as positive or negative based on the content of the statement.

**Technologies Used:**  
- Logistic Regression
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)

### 2. Face Recognition Project

**Description:**  
The face recognition project aims to perform face recognition using OpenCV, Haar cascade classifier for face detection, and LBPHFace recognizer. It captures faces, assigns IDs, detects faces using Haar cascade classifier, and recognizes faces in real-time.

**Technologies Used:**  
- OpenCV
- Haar Cascade Classifier
- LBPHFace Recognizer

### 3. Personalized Movie Recommendations

**Description:**  
This model employs the K Nearest Neighbours (KNN) algorithm to offer personalized movie suggestions by analyzing the preferences of similar users. It predicts how a target user would rate unseen films based on shared behaviors, providing accurate and relevant recommendations.

**Technologies Used:**  
- K Nearest Neighbours (KNN)
- Collaborative Filtering
- MovieLens Dataset

### 4. Trash Detection AI

**Description:**  
The Trash Detection project is aimed at detecting and classifying different types of trash in images using artificial intelligence techniques. It utilizes machine learning models to automatically identify and categorize various types of waste commonly found in images.

**Technologies Used:**  
- YOLO v8 Model
- TACO Dataset
